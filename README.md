# Facebook Authentication plugin for Joomla

This Git repository hosts the Facebook Authentication plugin for Joomla! 3.7 and later.

## Documentation

We have extensive documentation available in the [documentation wiki](https://github.com/joomla-extensions/facebook-auth/wiki).

## Support  

Please do not ask for generic support i.e. how to use this plugin, Joomla! or Facebook through direct messages to the developers or issues on the GitHub tracker. Due to the limited time of our volunteers these may receive no reply in a reasonable amount of time or at all. You can ask for support in the [official Joomla! forum](http://forum.joomla.org) or a local Joomla forum in your country / region. Joomla forums are active with thousands of people every day making it all the more likely that you'll get a fast reply.

## Collaboration

Bug reports and feature requests are very welcome but please do check if the same request has been made before. Duplicate issues will typically be closed as such. If you are a developer we encourage you to submit a Pull Request with the code pertaining to your bug fix or feature request.

## Translations

Up to date translation files are automatically included whenever we're making a new release of this plugin. There are no installable packages for individual languages.

Translations are managed through the [Joomla! Official Extensions project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/joomla-patchtester). The Joomla! Production Leadership Team has installed automated code in this repository to synchronise the language files with the Crowdin project.

If you are interested in becoming a translator please contact the translation team leader, [Marc Antoine Thevenet](https://crowdin.com/mail/compose/MAT978) on Crowdin. If you have questions about obtaining language packages please ask your question on the [Language board of the official Joomla! forum](http://forum.joomla.org/viewforum.php?f=711&sid=d94ca64e6a536ec2fa41651a1773395b). If you have suggestions about the language build process please contact the Joomla! Production Leadership Team as they ultimately have the last word on that.
